//only data type in enough in the declaration.
//data get pushed to stack and then POP out in the function.
//&nameofanything will print the memory address 
// *ptr display the value inside the memory ( example if a=32 *ptr of a will give u 32)
// ptr will show the adress of a certain variable, for example(print ptr) u will get the adress memory of that variable:
// INT A=2
// INT *PTR (ASSIGN A PLACE IN MEMORY FOR POINTER)
// PTR=&A U WILL GET ADRESS OF A HERE
// *PTR =A+1 YOU WILL GO TO ADRESS OF PTR WHICH REFERS TO A AND TAKE THE VALUE AND SUM THEM TOGTHER.
// the adress at ptr will stay the same, but after you do the summation you will overwrite on a 
//THE amout of memory adress the poiner take is always the same, the data type behind it is only if u want to extract the information out of that adress and make logic with it.
// check the value of first adrss in task2
